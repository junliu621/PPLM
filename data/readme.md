## Datasets

1. You can download the sequence pair dataset used to train **PPLM** through [pplm_dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xdb3SG0CRY49WqH4jUJhM-yqsLOejz7_/view?usp=share_link)<br>
2. You can access the original **protein-protein interaction** dataset from [D-SCRIPT](https://github.com/samsledje/D-SCRIPT/tree/main/data). The corrected pair lists by remove duplicate, erroneous, and invalid negative samples are provided in the **ppi** folder.<br>
3. You can access the original **protein-protein binding affinity** dataset from [PPB-Affinity](https://github.com/ChenPy00/PPB-Affinity). To prevent potential data leakage, we resplited the five-fold cross-validation list by considering the structure similarity, and the list of PDB IDs for each fold is provided in the **affinity** folder<br>.
4. You can download the **inter-protein contact prediction** dataset through [contact_dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xdb3SG0CRY49WqH4jUJhM-yqsLOejz7_/view?usp=share_link)<br>.
